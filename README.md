# Ayle

**AI Agent Office Simulation** — A top-down 2D pixel art game where AI-driven agents with distinct personalities live together in an office. You observe, rearrange the environment, and watch emergent social behavior unfold: friendships, rivalries, romances, grief, and drama.

Built with **Godot 4.6** (GDScript). Bundled LLM for offline AI decisions.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Agents** — Each agent has a unique procedurally generated personality (Big Five traits), appearance, and backstory. An LLM drives their decisions, conversations, and memories. A rich heuristic fallback ensures the game works without any LLM at all.
- **Emergent Relationships** — Agents form friendships, rivalries, romantic interests, and social groups organically based on personality compatibility and shared experiences.
- **Deep Memory** — Agents remember past conversations, events, and relationships. Memories influence future decisions and dialogue.
- **Life Simulation** — Agents age through life stages (young → adult → senior → dying), develop health conditions, and eventually die. Other agents grieve based on relationship closeness.
- **Drama Director** — A RimWorld-inspired storyteller paces random life events (arguments, promotions, secret admirers, office crises) for narrative satisfaction.
- **Conversations** — Multi-turn dialogues driven by LLM or heuristic fallback, flavored by personality traits, recent memories, and emotional state.
- **God Mode** — Place and remove objects, spawn/remove agents, and reshape the office environment.
- **Desktop Pet Mode** — Shrink the window to a transparent, borderless, always-on-top overlay with 3 agents living on your desktop.
- **20 Achievements** — Discovery, relationship, community, and milestone achievements to track your sandbox's progress.
- **Save System** — 5 save slots with automatic backups and corruption recovery. Auto-saves every 5 game-days.
- **Procedural Everything** — Sprites, audio, and personalities are all generated at runtime. No external art or sound assets required.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Godot 4.6](https://godotengine.org/download) or later

### Run from Editor

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/rsanandres/ayle.git
cd ayle

# Open in Godot
godot --editor project.godot
```

Press **F5** or click Play to launch.

### Run from CLI

```bash
godot --path /path/to/ayle
```

### LLM Setup (Optional)

The game works fully without any LLM — agents use a personality-driven heuristic brain with 200+ diverse dialogue lines.

For LLM-enhanced gameplay, install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) and pull a model:

```bash
ollama pull smollm2:1.7b
```

Configure the Ollama endpoint in **Settings > LLM** from the main menu. The game auto-detects Ollama at `localhost:11434`.

## Architecture

17 autoload singletons orchestrated through a global **EventBus** (~40 signals):

```
EventBus ← TimeManager ← Config ← SettingsManager
    ↓
AgentManager → LLMManager → GameManager → ConversationManager
    ↓
DramaDirector → EventManager → SaveManager → GroupManager
    ↓
Narrator → AudioManager → AchievementManager → TutorialManager → SteamManager
```

### Agent Pipeline

```
Think Tick (5s round-robin)
    → Brain (LLM or Heuristic)
        → Decision (idle / use object / talk to agent)
            → State Machine (IDLE → DECIDING → WALKING → INTERACTING/TALKING)
                → Needs decay, memory formation, relationship updates
```
