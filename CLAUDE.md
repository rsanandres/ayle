This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Ayle — AI Agent Office Simulation. A top-down 2D pixel art game where AI agents with distinct personalities live together in an office. The player observes and rearranges the environment as emergent social behavior unfolds. Built with Godot 4.6 (GDScript) with bundled LLM (GDLlama) + Ollama fallback.

## Build & Development

- **Engine**: Godot 4.6 (GDScript)
- **LLM Backend**: Bundled (GDLlama GDExtension) → Ollama → heuristic fallback
- Open project in Godot editor: `godot --editor project.godot`
- Run from CLI: `godot --path /Users/raph/Documents/ayle`
- Parse check: `godot --headless -e --quit-after 5`

## Architecture

### Autoloads (17 singletons, load order matters)
- `EventBus` — Global signal bus (~40 signals)
- `TimeManager` — Game clock (1 real sec = 1 game minute at 1x), pause/1x/2x/3x
- `Config` — Constants (need decay rates, speeds, thresholds)
- `SettingsManager` — Persists user settings to `user://settings.cfg` (MUST load before LLMManager/AudioManager)
- `AgentManager` — Agent registry, round-robin think ticks, spawn/remove
- `LLMManager` — Backend abstraction: bundled (GDLlama) → Ollama → heuristic
- `GameManager` — Top-level game state, selected agent tracking
- `ConversationManager` — Active conversations, prevents double-booking
- `DramaDirector` — RimWorld-style storyteller pacing events for narrative satisfaction
- `EventManager` — Random/triggered life events with probabilities and cooldowns
- `SaveManager` — Multi-slot (5) save system with `.bak` backup and corruption recovery
- `GroupManager` — Social group formation and rivalry tracking
- `Narrator` — Storyline tracking and narrative arc management
- `AudioManager` — 3 audio buses (Music/SFX/Ambient), crossfade, procedural fallback sounds
- `AchievementManager` — 20 achievements, persists to `user://achievements.json`, Steam sync
- `TutorialManager` — Contextual hints for new players
- `SteamManager` — GodotSteam wrapper (graceful no-op without Steam)

### Key Directories
- `autoloads/` — Singleton scripts + LLM backend modules
- `scenes/agents/` — Agent scene, needs, brain, memory, relationships
- `scenes/objects/` — InteractableObject base + 9 object types
- `scenes/conversations/` — ConversationInstance (multi-turn LLM dialogues)
- `scenes/events/` — EventManager, EventDefinition
- `scenes/world/` — Office layout with navigation, day/night tinting
- `scenes/ui/` — HUD, main menu, settings, save picker, achievements, hints, toasts
- `scenes/main/` — Root game scene
- `scripts/enums/` — AgentState, NeedType, ActionType, LifeStage
- `scripts/data/` — MemoryEntry, PersonalityProfile, RelationshipEntry, HealthState
- `scripts/utils/` — SpriteFactory, Palette, PromptBuilder, AudioGenerator
- `resources/` — Personalities (JSON), prompts (TXT), events (JSON), achievements (JSON)

### Agent Systems
- **Needs**: energy, hunger, social, productivity, health — decay over game time
- **Brain**: LLM-powered with heuristic fallback (200+ diverse dialogue lines)
- **Memory**: Scored retrieval, emotional metadata, narrative threads, life summaries (max 300)
- **Relationships**: Per-pair affinity/trust/familiarity/romantic_interest, personality compatibility
- **Health**: Aging through life stages (young→adult→senior→dying→dead), conditions, grief
- **Mood**: Visible emoji indicators (happy, tired, hungry, angry, sick, romantic)
- **State machine**: IDLE → DECIDING → WALKING → INTERACTING / TALKING → IDLE
- **Sprites**: 6-frame procedural pixel art (2 idle + 4 walk cycle)

### Objects (9 types)
desk, couch, coffee_machine, water_cooler (2 occupants), whiteboard (3 occupants), bookshelf, plant (passive), radio (toggleable), bed

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Space=pause, 1/2/3=speed, Tab=god mode, F5=save, F9=load, F12=screenshot, L=narrative log, R=relationships, Esc=close overlays

### Save/Load
5 save slots at `user://saves/slot_N.json` with `.bak` backup. Auto-save every 5 game-days. Legacy migration from single-file save.

### Audio
Procedural fallback (AudioGenerator) when WAV/OGG files missing. File-based audio takes priority when present. Music crossfade between tracks.
